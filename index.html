            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Our story,<span class="text-muted"> began at Roanoke College.</span></h2>
            <p class="lead"> As fate would have it, they had both been placed in Crawford Hall and lived on the same floor.  Jon and Jenny had been on different paths, Jenny pursuing a degree in psychology and Jon was pursing a degree in economics.  Jon had become a member the Sigma Chi Fraternity and Jenny a member of Phi Mu Sorority.  Jenny was President of the Panhellenic Council and Jon quickly grew a crush on the sweet southern belle when he became the treasurer of the Inter-Fraternity Council.  The crush grew into love and they began to frequently see each other at parties and the infamous Mac and Bobs.  After casually dating for months, they finally made if official their senior year.  After graduating, Jon headed back to New Jersey and Jenny back to Northern Virginia.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading center-block">Then we moved,<span class="text-muted"> to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">They spent the next several months after graduation traveling back and forth between New Jersey and Virginia to see each other.  In the Fall, Jon decided to head to Jackson Hole to fulfill a dream of being a ski-bum and living in a mountain town.  Shortly after, Jon was able to convince Jenny (who had never been skiing or past the Mississippi) to move out to Wyoming with him.  She bought a one-way ticket and a new winter parka and headed out west.  As an avid skier, Jon wanted Jenny to enjoy skiing as well and spent countless hours teaching Jenny to ski that winter.  With such an amazing ski coach, she grew to love it despite the challenging terrain.  Their love for each other grew deeper during those first winter months and they fell deeply in love with Jackson.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Got a dog,<span class="text-muted"> named Zeus.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead"> After their first winter, Jon and Jenny decided that living in Jackson would not be complete without a furry companion.  During their first off-season in Jackson, they trekked back to East Coast and searched endlessly for the best Golden Retriever they could find.  On the drive to Jenny’s parent’s house after their first Alumni Weekend at Roanoke College, they adopted Zeus - aptly named for his size and majestic presence.  They headed back to Jackson with Zeus in-tow and what was supposed to be one winter in Jackson quickly became three winters and two summers.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Moved again,<span class="text-muted"> this time to San Francisco, California.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">In 2012, after almost three years in Jackson, Jon and Jenny moved to New Jersey in the pursuit of graduate school and “real-life” jobs.  That Fall, Jon accepted a job offer in San Francisco and the two found themselves packing up their belongings once more and trekking across the country for their next adventure in California.  Jenny began her pursuit of a Master’s degree and Jon traded in his ski boots for California business casual and entered the financial workforce.  Even with their busy work and school schedules, they are still able to take advantage of living in the Bay Area.  Jon and Jenny spend most of their winter in Tahoe skiing, their city weekends finding nearby hikes, and take advantage of living close to the beach. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading center-block">Then he finally popped the question,<span class="text-muted"> and she said yes!</span></h2>
          <p class="lead"> Since moving to San Francisco, Jon began enjoying biking more.  He completed a couple of century bike rides, bikes to work when ever he can, and even completed a ride called “The Death Ride” in Tahoe.  Jon and Jenny both enjoyed biking in Jackson Hole, but she left her cruiser bike when they moved to California - Jon had assured her it would be near impossible to “cruise” the hills in San Francisco.  Jon wanted to share his new passion with Jenny and purchased her a new bike for Christmas.  A couple months later while training for his next century, Jon purchased himself a new bike and begged Jenny to go on the first ride with him.  Jenny assumed Jon wanted her to tag along to take a picture of him with his new bike at the top of the mountain, little did Jenny know, Jon had a something special planed.  Jon led her across the Golden Gate Bridge to the Marin Headlands towards Hawk Hill, a mountain accent which he claimed would be a quick 10 minute climb.  Many, many minutes (and several breaks) after the first 10 minutes, they arrived at the top of the mountain.  There, wearing spandex bike shorts and covered in sweat, Jon went down on one knee with a magnificent view of San Francisco in the background and popped the question!  Excited to learn she wasn’t just there to be a photographer, she was ecstatically said YES!  They enjoyed a much more leisurely downhill bike ride back to city where they celebrated with Zeus and dined at one of their favorite neighborhood restaurants.  Since April, they have been planning their wedding weekend and are so excited to celebrate with friends and family in one of their favorite places on Earth. </p>
