Jon had become a member the Sigma Chi fraternity, and Jenny a member of Phi Mu sorority. Jenny was President of the Panhellenic Council and Jon quickly grew a crush on the smart and sexy girl when he became the treasure of the Inter-fraternity council. The crush grew into love and they began to frequently see each other at parties and other events. After casually dating for months, they finally made if official their senior year.

In the Fall Jon decided to head Jackson Hole to fulfill a dream of being a ski-bum.  Shortly after, Jon was able to convince Jenny who had never been skiing or past the Mississippi to move out to Wyoming with him.  Jon wanted Jenny to enjoy skiing as much as he did and spent countless hours teaching Jenny to ski that winter, and she grew to love it despite the challenging terrane.  They fell deeply in love with each other and their new home that winter.</p>

That Fall Jon accepted a job offer in San Francisco and the two found themselves packing up their belongings once more and trekking across the country for their next adventure in California.  Jenny continued to presume a carrier in School Counseling enrolled in a Graduate Program. Even with their busy work and school schedules they are still able to take advantage of living in the Bay Area. Jon and Jenny still spend most of their winter in Tahoe Skiing and take advantage of living close to the beach and great hikes when its not foggy in the city. </p>

          <p class="lead"> Since moving to San Francisco, Jon had started biking a lot. He completed a couple centuries and bikes to work when ever he can.  Jon and Jenny both enjoyed biking in Jackson Hole, but she left her bike when they moved to California since it got trashed in Hurricane Sandy.  Jon wanted to share his new passion with Jenny and purchased her a new bike. A couple months later while training for his next century Jon purchased himself a new bike and begged Jenny to go on the first ride with him.  Jenny assumed Jon wanted her to tag along to take a picture of him with his new bike at the top of the mountain, little did Jenny know, Jon had a something special planed.  Jon led her across the Golden Gate Bridge to the Marin Headlands towards Hawk Hill, a mountain accent which he claimed would be a quick 10 minutes climb.  Many, many minutes after the first 10 minutes and several breaks later, they arrived at the top of the mountain.  There, wearing spandex and covered in sweat Jon went down on one knee with a magnificent view of San Francisco in the background he popped the question! Excited to learn she wasn’t just there to be a photographer, she was ecstatic to say YES!</p>
