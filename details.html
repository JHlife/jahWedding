          <p class="lead">Jackson Hole is located in the western part of Wyoming, minutes from the Idaho border.  Jackson Hole boasts the only airport to be located in a National Park.  Jon and Jenny believe it is the most beautiful airport in the world.  Airfare can be expensive so they suggest purchasing tickets as early as possible.  Many hotels offer transportation to and from the airport, a mere 15 minutes from town.  If you're looking for a cheaper option or if you’re interested in taking a long scenic drive, Idaho Falls is the 2<sup>nd</sup> closest airport.  If you don't mind a longer trek, Salt Lake City airport is the closest after.  Close to 5 hours away, this airport offers more options for flights and usually cheaper airfare.  Rental cars and shuttles are available from Idaho Falls and Salt Lake City.</p>
